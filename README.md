TCGA Regulome Explorer

Regulome Explorer is a tool for exploring and understanding genomic association analyses.  It is an HTML5 web application that uses multiple visualizations to provide users with a means to dive into relationships between complex, heterogenous data features.

The previous version of RE is deployed at [explorer.cancerregulome.org/all_pairs/](explorer.cancerregulome.org/all_pairs/) and [explorer.cancerregulome.org/re/](explorer.cancerregulome.org/re/)

This is a new implementation of RE that does not share codebase with the previous version.  If you are looking for the source code for the previous version of RE, go to [www.googlecode.com/p/regulome-explorer/](www.googlecode.com/p/regulome-explorer/)
